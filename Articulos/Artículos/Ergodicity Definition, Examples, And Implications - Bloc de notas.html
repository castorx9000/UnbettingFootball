In my cousin’s case, the broken leg preventing him from competing in future races is a “phantom consequence” that is not observable in the short term but affects the long term. If we make decisions based on what happens over narrow intervals and forget about these “phantom consequences,” we will make bad decisions.[ 8] Ergodicity is the study of these phantom consequences.[ 9]

El acto de robar por supervivencia o amenaza de supervivencia es un ejemplo:

Los cazadores furtivos en la edad media que, por hambre, se veían forzados a cazar en las tierras que pertenecían al Señor Feudal, se enfrentaban a la pena de muerte si eran atrapados. 

Durante el robo te conviene tener el mejor desempeño posible (por el riesgo de muerte), pero en el largo plazo no te conviene robar (por lo irreversible: la muerte, vuelve pérdida todo lo posterior).

Too often, we observe a snapshot of someone’s life and believe that we witnessed a piece of short- term performance. But if practice is required to get to a place where one can attempt that, then what we are really observing is long- term performance. A professional skier in his 30s successfully managed risk in the previous decades– no matter what he seems doing in this one race we’re observing.

People who replied “$ 500,000” to the previous question assumed that death in one round just means that no winnings are collected during that round, but future rounds are still winnable.

AngelList founder Naval Ravikant wisely noted that envy is most often an illusion. “The part of the person that we envy doesn’t exist without the rest of that person,” he writes. “If we aren’t willing to trade places with them completely– their life, their body, their thoughts– then there is nothing to be envious about.” I would add that it is also pointless to envy someone with whom you wouldn’t trade places in all parallel universes– including those in which his gambles didn’t pay off. For example, an entrepreneur whose venture had slim chances to succeed.[ 26] Do you desire to take his gambles, or do you only desire the winning outcome? Do not envy the survivors of ventures in which you don’t wish to participate, and do not envy successes that don’t reproduce well.[ 27]

Of course, average data does not tell us the full story. If every hospital in Italy had 10% of their beds occupied by patients, everyone would have gotten proper medical attention.

Hence the saying, centralization is only efficient to the central observer. The closer someone lives to the capital, and the more his culture and social status match those of the governors, the more he will care about what the central organization is good at, and the less he will care about what it’s bad at. When evaluating centralization, make sure you ask everyone, not just those close to you.

If you find yourself in a non- ergodic context, do not care about the average outcome, but about your own. Do not rely on averages but on probabilities of irreversible individual outcome. Use more granular data. Ask yourself what might happen to you. Ask yourself if and how unexpected losses can negate your future plans. For example, do not invest all your money in the one investment with the highest average return. Instead, consider what would happen in case of a downturn. Do not care about average returns– only about those with which you could end up.

The point is, the best strategy depends on whether you are the gambler or the gamble. If you are the gambler, you do not care about each gamble making money. You care about the aggregate of all gambles making money. Conversely, if you are the gamble (in this example, the founder), you do not care about the overall outcome of all gambles but only yours.

You: a gambler Even if you do not play gambling games, it might be useful to see yourself as a gambler. After all, each of your habits is a gamble in which you bet time and energy for a possible return. Similarly, any belief of yours is a gamble. Any job of yours, any relationship of yours, any idea, any decision– they are all investments of time and money in exchange for a future return.[ 37] You might be tempted to strive to win any single gamble of yours. Don’t. You can afford to let go of a few losing ones.[ 38] Their survival is not necessary for yours.[ 39] Remember, the best strategy for the gamble isn’t necessarily the best strategy for the gambler.[ 40]

In general, the survival of a population does not coincide with the survival of its members, not all of them.[ 43] [44] Of course, this applies to some contexts only. We can call them “non- ergodic.” This is not a complete nor precise definition of ergodicity. However, it is a valuable one, for it provides an important distinction. In non- ergodic contexts, you cannot be idealistic and believe that your survival coincides with that of your company or country. You must take additional steps to take care of yourself.

This is not about ethics. The point is that a population doesn’t have, by default, an incentive for the survival of all its members. Even if the population means good for its members– especially so. A population must first and foremost ensure its survival to guarantee the survival of its members. And if the survival of the population doesn’t coincide with the survival of all its members– as is the case in non- ergodic conditions–, a well- meaning population won’t necessarily guarantee the survival of all its members, not when it comes at the cost of its own survival.

Así es el fútbol, en el largo plazo todos son reemplazados. Los clubes son ergodicos porque son irreemplazables (Liga MX), al menos en cierto plazo; 

Los descensos plantean un riesgo de irreversibilidad, pero este puede ser paliado o hasta suprimido con la disparidad entre clubes. Un Manchester City puede comprar su ergodicidad. 

Todos los actores (DT, jugadores, directivos) son reemplazables para el club, pero como actores son del tipo emprendedor que puede reiniciar su apuesta en otro club, incluso, de otro país. Sin embargo, los jugadores tienen irreversibilidad (lesiones, accidentes, problemas legales).

El problema de baja tasa de exportación de la Liga MX es un problema de volumen. Para que Monterrey y Tigres no acaparen el poco talento exportable, debe producirse más talento, para que se abarate. La MLS es el otro problema, pero en específico el Jugador Designado. Todo esto produce que, irónicamente, todos pierdan, menos el jugador.

La solución intervencionista sería imponer un arancel o barrera a los clubes, como, por ejemplo, obligarles a vender 1 jugador al año al extranjero. Esto sería una solución parcial en el mejor de los casos, en la medida en que resuelva o no el problema del volumen. De no resolver el problema del volumen solo seguiría la liga subsanando el déficit local de talento comprando excedentes de talento del extranjero.

Natural selection benefits populations. This is good news if you are a population and bad news if you are one of its weak members. In the latter case, you can turn the tables by making natural selection work for you rather than against you. The trick is to become a population yourself. This is easier than it seems– after all, you already are a population: of habits and beliefs. If you let the feedback you receive from your environment hurt the habits and beliefs that are holding you back, you are effectively making natural selection act inside you rather than on you.[ 47] You become stronger rather than extinct. You are not your habits nor your beliefs. You are their container. Their survival is not yours. What’s best for them might or might not be what’s best for you.

Fully relaying on averages and expected outcomes makes sense only in ergodic contexts. In non- ergodic ones, you want to ensure that you make decisions based on an estimate of your lifetime outcome.[ 50] Similarly, when we see a behavior that we deem illogical or irrational, it is often worth asking ourselves, “is it irrational for an ergodic world, but rational for a non- ergodic one?”

Using the words of Spear of Lugh[ 52], Ergodicity is verified if, more or less, every time that you compute a statistical measurement (across space or time), you find the same result. It means that randomness is “well shared.” Another way to see it is that, when you have ergodicity, doing N random experiments in parallel will give you the same result as doing N experiments one after the other.

After a game- over, you cannot keep playing. Game- overs are a form of irreversibility, but they are not the only one. Here is another. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb noted, in some societies, if you’re poor, you’re likely to stay poor, and if you’re rich, you’re likely to stay rich. In these societies, one cannot assume that the lifetime outcome of a person born poor will coincide with the average of the population. He is likely to stay below average. Such a society in which wealth is at least partially irreversible is non- ergodic.[ 53]

Therefore, ergodicity is not just the property of an activity. Instead, ergodicity is a property of an activity, its participants, and the exposure of the latter to the former– in short, of a system.

The fact that ergodicity depends not only on the activity performed but also on your exposure to it is good news for you. It means that you can still participate ergodically in non- ergodic activities if you limit your exposure to non- ergodicity.

Instead of going all- in on a single bet, take many independent bets.[ 57] - Use protections (of all kinds– Personal Protective Equipment, insurances, capped- downside options, and so on). - Set aside some buffers and reserves (of money, time, trust, etc.) so that even if you lose everything you committed to an activity, you still have some set aside to recover.[ 58]

This doesn’t mean that people don’t care about negative events with a mean- time- to- happen higher than their time horizon. A rational entrepreneur with a 10- years time horizon still cares about a risk that is expected to materialize every 11 years. Instead, it means that people neglect events that don’t create a meaningful gap between lifetime and population outcomes when measured over the time horizon of their concern.

Hence, for most people, what matters is how much the lifetime outcome diverges from the population outcome in the medium term. For example, if the time average of my wealth after 70 years is 90% of its expected value, then it is not meaningless to say that the investment is 90% ergodic. Or, in the example above, if my grandma’s wealth time average equals its expected value 99% of lifetimes, it is not meaningless to say that the activity is 99% ergodic. Of course, neither are fully correct, but here is the thing: the value of such statements is not in whether they are right, but in whether they lead to good follow- up questions.

The irreversibility of time In most of the examples described so far, non- ergodicity caused a permanent loss of money, health, reputation, or other assets. There is one more resource that we lose permanently: time. No calculation, thought experiment, or study can pretend to model real- life behavior if it assumes time as infinite. Such an arbitrary and unwarranted assumption can lead to mistakenly classify an irrational behavior as rational or the other way around.

The Ludic fallacy I first learned about the Ludic Fallacy from Nassim Nicholas Taleb. He made a thought experiment: imagine that a coin falls ten times in a row on its “heads” side. What are the chances of it falling “heads” on the eleventh flip? If you answered, “50% because flips are independent” you committed the Ludic Fallacy– you assumed that the rules described the game, failing to consider the possibilities of the coin being uneven or the flipper being a skilled swindler.

In many situations, you want to increase the ergodicity of the systems you’re a part of. For example, if you are an investor, the less ergodic your investments, the lower their lifetime returns.[ 60] Hence, you want to make your investments as ergodic as possible.[ 61]

In investing, the barbell strategy consists of allocating part of one’s wealth in non- risky assets and part in risky ones with high upside (the asymmetry being reminiscent of a barbell). Investors who do so find themselves wealthier than those investing all their wealth in medium- risk assets[ 63] (a shape that would remind of a regular rod). One reason is that a medium- risk investment is less likely to suffer large losses but is not immune to them. And, over long- enough timeframes, “less likely” means “eventually.” The barbell strategy consists of exposing most of yourself to safe activities and a tiny bit of yourself to risky ones with high upside.

This apparently banal strategy is clever than it seems. By reducing the amount exposed to risk, it prevents a single loss, or a short series of losses, from constituting a game- over. It also gives you the opportunity, after some bad luck, to “exit”– a luxury that more invested participants lack. Moreover, this strategy acknowledges that, in most contexts, a small exposure to high upside brings higher returns than a moderate exposure to moderate upside. This is particularly relevant in contexts where returns cluster. That said, the distribution of returns is not the point here.

One lesson from Taleb’s work is that risk management is not about prudence but about removing the risks of “game- over” so that you can be aggressive with other risks. Similarly, the barbell strategy is not about reducing risk in general. Instead, it is about limiting the part of your assets that are exposed to irreversibility. A balanced or medium- risk exposure does not do the trick. It would be like playing Russian Roulette with one- in- twelve bullets rather than one- in- six: it just means that the game- over is delayed but does not prevent it. Conversely, the barbell strategy is like playing Russian Roulette without pointing the gun to your skull but to a $ 100 banknote. If you’re unlucky (when you’re unlucky), you only lose the banknote, not your life. Accordingly, here is an alternative formulation of the barbell strategy. “Preserve your ergodicity by investing in non- ergodic activities only what can be lost without endangering the whole.”

I routinely use the Kelly Criterion[ 67]. As an author, consultant, and researcher, I spend most of my time writing books and essays, working with clients, and researching. All of these projects take time, and time is money. If I invested all my time for the next three years on a single project or client, I would be in a terrible condition in case of failure. Instead, I allocate my time on a per- project basis. Usually, the larger the upside, the more time I spend on the project. However, I always make sure to never commit all of my time to a single project running for extended time. Too much to lose, both in case the project doesn’t go well or in terms of opportunity costs.

Careful, though, on whether your survival is necessary to theirs. This is one of the reasons I’m skeptical of the idea of managing a country as if it were a company. When you manage a company, you do not have to hire every applicant, and employees can decide to leave and find themselves another company. Conversely, citizens cannot find themselves another country.

A key decision every company makes, deliberately or not, is: what is our time horizon? As we saw in the introduction, that is the key decision that will influence all future decisions. For if the time horizon is short, the negative consequences of overworking employees won’t be considered; and if the time horizon is long, they will. Time horizons affect the importance of irreversible consequences.

Even though the population is still non- ergodic, any measurement of “survival” on a sample that includes you becomes similar to any sample of the population, so that ergodicity is satisfied for what concerns you and your membership to that population. (If you are irreplaceable for a population, then for the population your survival becomes their survival– not in the meaning that their numerical value is similar, but in their behavioral implication.)
